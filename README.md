# Feedreader Test Suit project

By opening the Index.html you can start up the feedreader. It should show serveral feed entries, and by clicking on the hamburger menu at the top left you can change the feed.

If you plan to change the code, there are serveral tests written to assure the functionality of the feed reader. These tests use jasmine to check if everythng works correctly. So if something does not work correctly anymore, just look at the bottom of the page and check if all tests pass. If a test does not pass the information at the bottom of the page will help you do find out where the error occures.
